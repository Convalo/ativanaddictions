              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTIONS: NOT THE DRUG TO MESS AROUND WITH</strong></h2>
              <p>It&rsquo;s true: when abused, no drug is a safe drug. <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> easily falls under this category. Because Ativan is highly addictive, most in the medical profession suggest use of the drug be supervised by a doctor or clinical expert.</p>
              <p>Secondly, Ativan should also be <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">prescribed for short periods of use</a> because of the strong risk of physical and psychological dependence that the drug causes.<br>
                Of course, the most severe side effects associated with Ativan use occur during exposure to high doses of the drug. These side effects can include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Depressed respiration</li>
                <li>Seizures</li>
                <li>Memory impairment</li>
                <li>Excessive sedation</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>WHAT TYPE OF TREATMENT DO I NEED?</strong></h2>
              <p>Everyone&rsquo;s addiction is different. This is because each person processes drugs differently. Much depends on their overall health, age, weight, as well as exposure to other drugs, etc. All this information, including how high a dosage and how long a person is a user of Ativan can determine whether or not they require <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/a-journey-in-detox">in or outpatient rehabilitation</a>, and how intense that rehab should be.</p>
              <p>It isn&rsquo;t the easiest of calls, but a qualified rehabilitation center with a certified staff can offer comprehensive suggestions as to how you or your loved one should approach their recovery from Ativan.</p>
              <h2><strong>IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT DO I DO?</strong></h2>
              <p>If you fear you have an issue with Ativan, check yourself over for these withdrawal symptoms that can come up if you temporarily stop using the drug.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Anxiety and nausea that can be due to the drug no longer calming the user. They are now anxious and scattered, which can lead to psychological, emotional and physical stress.</li>
                <li>A need to increase the dosage of their Ativan use because they&rsquo;ve built up tolerance to the drug.</li>
                <li>Cravings, which are known as the true sign of the psychological aspect of Ativan addiction. With cravings, you or your loved one&rsquo;s mind is affixed to Ativan and little else. Cravings are at their worst during initial withdrawal, and can include:</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Sweating</li>
                  <li>Trembling and shaking</li>
                  <li>Muscle spasms</li>
                  <li>Dizziness</li>
                  <li>Nausea</li>
                  <li>Rapid heart rate</li>
                  <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>IF YOU HAVE AN ATIVAN ADDICTION, SEEK OUT TREATMENT NOW</strong></h2>
              <p>Don&rsquo;t let Ativan addiction hang around. The last thing a dependency like this needs is to linger, particularly with the adverse effects the drug has.</p>
              <p>Instead of just <em>dealing </em>with the drug, or attempting to detox and rehab on your own (which is a very dangerous proposition as it is), seek out the best rehabilitation facility you can find within reason of your budget as well as the quality of care you expect toward your recovery. </p>
              <p>In the end, addressing you or your loved one&rsquo;s addiction to Ativan, is an issue that requires attention right now.</p>
